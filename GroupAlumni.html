                    Martin obtained his PhD in 2015 from the Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology at University of Copenhagen. The main focus of the PhD was investigating transiently formed oligomeric species of alpha-synuclein either on or off pathway to the fibrillar species well known from Parkinson’s disease. After finishing his PhD, he went on to work as a beamline postdoc at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). At ESRF he gained valuable experience with both pump-probe and stopped-flow techniques for time-resolved experiments with X-rays.
                  </br>
                </br>
                    Martin’s main interest is developing methods, both experimentally and in data analysis, to investigate the underlying nature of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Time-resolved experiments (pump-probe, stopped-flow and continuous-flow) are key in this pursuit, and one of his main foci in the group is to make use of microfluidic chips for time-resolved experiments.

                    Martin’s work is funded by the BRAINSTRUC project.</br>

                  <p>Martin finished his diploma thesis in physics at the Friedrich-Schiller-University in Jena in 2009 in the at that time emerging field of transformation optics. During his PhD in Tobias Unruh's work group at the FRM-II / Technical University of Munich (2009-11), and later on at Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (2011-15), he studied structures in lipid soft-matter dispersions by small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, wide-angle X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic light scattering. He used the same techniques to assist other researchers in their studies on liquid crystals, polymers and porous materials. Now he is working as a postdoc on the <a href="IndustryResearch.html">LINX project</a> to analyze nanostructures with small-angle scattering in products from various Danish companies. </br>

                  <p> Søren Roi Midtgaard is a post doctoral researcher at the Niels Bohr Institute at University of Copenhagen, Denmark. After undergraduate studies in nanoscience at University of Aarhus, Denmark Søren moved to Copenhagen to perform doctoral studies at the department of Chemistry where he was awarded the PhD degree in 2013.</br>

                  Søren’s main interest lies in the structural understanding of biological processes, which after initial projects centered around NMR and crystallography has led to heavy use of small-angle scattering. As especially small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is currently under rapid development, a desire to exploit these possibilities to the fullest has led to involvement in numerous industrial and scientific collaborations.</br>
