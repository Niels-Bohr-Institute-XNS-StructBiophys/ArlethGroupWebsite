          <h2>Welcome to the website of the Arleth Group at UCPH!</h2>
          <p>
            The group is situated at the <a href="http://xns.nbi.ku.dk">X-ray and Neutron Science section</a> at the <a href="http://nbi.ku.dk">Niels Bohr Institute</a>, <a href="http://www.ku.dk">University of Copenhagen</a>. It is headed by professor Lise Arleth, and specialises in the study of biological systems using small-angle scattering techniques, i.e. SAXS and SANS. Almost all experiments are performed at large-scale facilities, such as synchrotrons and reactors.</br>

          </p> </br>

          <h3>Trip to SAS2018 Conference</h3>
          <p>
            During October 2018 a large part of our group had a very nice trip to the SAS2018 conference in Traverse City in the USA. The conference was filled with interesting talks, and socializing with collegues and long-time collaborators.
          </br>
            We were a rather large delegation: Joao and Tone from the Biological department, Kell and Anine from our section, and Lise, Nicolai, Andreas, Frederik and Lasse from the Arleth Group. On the picture above, we're joined by Jan Skov Pedersen and Jannik N. Pedersen from Aarhus University. Remarkably, everyone of us gave talks, and left a significant mark on the biochemistry and soft-matter related sessions.
          </br>
        </br>
            Furthermore, Andreas was awarded this years Otto Kratky Prize for his talk titled: <i>Analysis of Small-Angle Scattering Data Using Model Fitting and Bayesian Regularization</i>. Congratulations to him from the entire group!

          <h3>Venturing into real space</h3>
          <p>
            As a group focused on scattering experiments, we usually prefer to work in reciprocal space, however, we have recently ventured into real space, by performing electron microscopy on some of our protein samples.
          </br>
            One example is our recent negative stained electron microscopy experiments on nanodiscs with apolipoprotein E as a belt protein, and the results are very promising. It seems like we can benefit greatly from combining our usual SAXS and SANS approach with electron microscopy to get a complete picture (now literally) of these biological macromolecules.
          </br>
            Thanks to Thomas Boesen from Aarhus University, Klaus Qvortrup and Tillmann Pape from the Core Facility for Integrated Microscopy (CFIM) and Michael Gajhede from department of drug design and pharmacology at University of Copenhagen for support with data collection and reduction.
