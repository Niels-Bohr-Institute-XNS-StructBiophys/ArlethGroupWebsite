          Presently, she and her group have a special focus on developing approaches for investigating membrane proteins under solution conditions. Almost all experiments are carried out at international large scale facilities (X-ray synchrotrons and Neutron scattering facilities) in highly interdisciplinary and international scientific environments. Lise Arleth is strongly engaged in the European Spallation Source (ESS) and the Max-IV Synchrotron projects. Lise Arleth is partner in the Lundbeck Foundation funded <a href="BRAINSTRUC.html">BRAINSTRUC project</a>, the Novo Nordisk Foundation funded <a href="Synergy.html"> Synergy project</a> as well as the Danish Innovation Foundation funded <a href="LINX.html">LINX project</a></br>

During his PhD in Tobias Unruh's work group at the FRM-II / Technical University of Munich (2009-11), and later on at Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (2011-15), he studied structures in lipid soft-matter dispersions by small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, wide-angle X-ray scattering, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic light scattering. He used the same techniques to assist other researchers in their studies on liquid crystals, polymers and porous materials. Now he is working as a postdoc on the <a href="LINX.html">LINX project</a> to analyze nanostructures with small-angle scattering in products from various Danish companies. </br>

          Søren’s main interest lies in the structural understanding of biological processes, which after initial projects centered around NMR and crystallography has led to heavy use of small-angle scattering. As especially small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is currently under rapid development, a desire to exploit these possibilities to the fullest has led to involvement in numerous industrial and scientific collaborations.</br>
