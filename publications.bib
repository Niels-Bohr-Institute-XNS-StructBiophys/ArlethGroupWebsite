abstract = {The AMPA receptor GluA2 belongs to the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are responsible for most of the fast excitatory neuronal signalling in the central nervous system. These receptors are important for memory and learning, but have also been associated with brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Today, one drug is on the market for the treatment of epilepsy targeting AMPA receptors, {\it i.e.} a negative allosteric modulator of these receptors. Recently, crystal structures and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of full-length GluA2 in the resting (apo), activated and desensitized states have been reported. Here, solution structures of full-length GluA2 are reported using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with a novel, fully matched-out detergent. The GluA2 solution structure was investigated in the resting state as well as in the presence of AMPA and of the negative allosteric modulator GYKI-53655. In solution and at neutral pH, the SANS data clearly indicate that GluA2 is in a compact form in the resting state. The solution structure resembles the crystal structure of GluA2 in the resting state, with an estimated maximum distance ({\it D}${\sb max}$) of 179 {$\pm$} 11{\AA} and a radius of gyration ({\it R}${\sb g}$) of 61.9 {$\pm$} 0.4{\AA}. An {\it ab initio} model of GluA2 in solution generated using {\it DAMMIF} clearly showed the individual domains, {\it i.e.} the extracellular N-terminal domains and ligand-binding domains as well as the transmembrane domain. Solution structures revealed that GluA2 remained in a compact form in the presence of AMPA or GYKI-53655. At acidic pH only, GluA2 in the presence of AMPA adopted a more open conformation of the extracellular part (estimated {\it D}${\sb max}$ of 189 {$\pm$} 5{\AA} and {\it R}${\sb g}$ of 65.2 {$\pm$} 0.5{\AA}), resembling the most open, desensitized class 3 cryo-EM structure of GluA2 in the presence of quisqualate. In conclusion, this methodological study may serve as an example for future SANS studies on membrane proteins.},

abstract = {The structure of macromolecules can be studied by small-angle scattering (SAS), but as this is an ill-posed problem, prior knowledge about the sample must be included in the analysis. Regularization methods are used for this purpose, as already implemented in indirect Fourier transformation and bead-modeling-based analysis of SAS data, but not yet in the analysis of SAS data with analytical form factors. To fill this gap, a Bayesian regularization method was implemented, where the prior information was quantified as probability distributions for the model parameters and included {\it via} a functional {\it S}. The quantity {\it Q} = {$\chi$}${\sp 2}$ + {$\alpha$}{\it S} was then minimized and the value of the regularization parameter {$\alpha$} determined by probability maximization. The method was tested on small-angle X-ray scattering data from a sample of nanodiscs and a sample of micelles. The parameters refined with the Bayesian regularization method were closer to the prior values as compared with conventional {$\chi$}${\sp 2}$ minimization. Moreover, the errors on the refined parameters were generally smaller, owing to the inclusion of prior information. The Bayesian method stabilized the refined values of the fitted model upon addition of noise and can thus be used to retrieve information from data with low signal-to-noise ratio without risk of overfitting. Finally, the method provides a measure for the information content in data, {\it N}${\sb g}$, which represents the effective number of retrievable parameters, taking into account the imposed prior knowledge as well as the noise level in data.},

abstract = {A novel and generally applicable method for determining structures of membrane proteins in solution via small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is presented. Common detergents for solubilizing membrane proteins were synthesized in isotope-substituted versions for utilizing the intrinsic neutron scattering length difference between hydrogen and deuterium. Individual hydrogen/deuterium levels of the detergent head and tail groups were achieved such that the formed micelles became effectively invisible in heavy water (D2O) when investigated by neutrons. This way, only the signal from the membrane protein remained in the SANS data. We demonstrate that the method is not only generally applicable on five very different membrane proteins but also reveals subtle structural details about the sarco/endoplasmatic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). In all, the synthesis of isotope-substituted detergents makes solution structure determination of membrane proteins by SANS and subsequent data analysis available to nonspecialists.}

	Abstract = {{The increasingly narrow and brilliant beams at X-ray facilities reduce
   the requirements for both sample volume and data acquisition time. This
   creates new possibilities for the types and number of sample conditions
   that can be examined but simultaneously increases the demands in terms
   of sample preparation. Microfluidic-based sample preparation techniques
   have emerged as elegant alternatives that can be integrated directly
   into the experimental X-ray setup remedying several shortcomings of more
   traditional methods. We review the use of microfluidic devices in
   conjunction with X-ray measurements at synchrotron facilities in the
   context of 1) mapping large parameter spaces, 2) performing time
   resolved studies of mixing-induced kinetics, and 3)
   manipulating/processing samples in ways which are more demanding or not
   accessible on the macroscale. The review covers the past 15 years and
   focuses on applications where synchrotron data collection is performed
   in situ, i.e. directly on the microfluidic platform or on a sample jet
   from the microfluidic device. Considerations such as the choice of
   materials and microfluidic designs are addressed. The combination of
   microfluidic devices and measurements at large scale X-ray facilities is
   still emerging and far from mature, but it definitely offers an exciting
   array of new possibilities.}},

	Abstract = {{Three dimers of the amphipathic a-helical peptide 18A have been
   synthesized with different interhelical linkers inserted between the two
   copies of 18A. The dimeric peptides were denoted `beltides' where
   Beltide-1 refers to the 18A-dimer without a linker, Beltide-2 is the
   18A-dimer with proline (Pro) as a linker and Beltide-3 is the 18A-dimer
   linked by two glycines (Gly-Gly). The self-assembly of the beltides with
   the phospholipid DMPC was studied with and without the incorporated
   membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) through a combination of
   coarse-grained MD simulations, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC),
   circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, small-angle scattering (SAS),
   static light scattering (SLS) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. For all three
   beltides, MD and combined small-angle X-ray and -neutron scattering were
   consistent with a disc structure composed by a phospholipid bilayer
   surrounded by a belt of peptides and with a total disc diameter of
   approximately 10 nm. CD confirmed that all three beltides were a-helical
   in the free form and with DMPC. However, as shown by SEC the different
   interhelical linkers clearly led to different properties of the
   beltides. Beltide-3, with the Gly-Gly linker, was very adaptable such
   that peptide nanodiscs could be formed for a broad range of different
   peptide to lipid stoichiometries and therefore also possible disc-sizes.
   On the other hand, both Beltide-2 with the Pro linker and Beltide-1
   without a linker were less adaptable and would only form discs of
   certain peptide to lipid stoichiometries. SLS revealed that the
   structural stability of the formed peptide nanodiscs was also highly
   affected by the linkers and it was found that Beltide-1 gave more stable
   discs than the other two beltides. With respect to membrane protein
   stabilization, each of the three beltides in combination with DMPC
   stabilizes the seven-helix transmembrane protein bacteriorhodopsin
   significantly better than the detergent octyl glucoside, but no
   significant difference was observed between the three beltides. We
   conclude that adaptability, size, and structural stability can be tuned
   by changing the interhelical linker while maintaining the properties of
   the discs with respect to membrane protein stabilization.}},

	Abstract = {{The influence of pH (from 7.5 to 4.0) on the hydrolysis and
   self-assembly process of nanotubes formed from partially hydrolysed
   bovine alpha-lactalbumin was studied. The results showed that the pH had
   no influence on the products resulting from hydrolysis, but a decrease
   in pH dramatically reduced the hydrolysis rate. In contrast, the
   self-assembly process was favoured by decreased pH due to the reduced
   electrostatic repulsion between the fragments making up the nanotubes.
   Initially, upon adding a protease, a rapid change in conformation was
   indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Subsequently no further
   change was observed. Due to slower hydrolysis and faster self-assembly
   at pH 6.5 and 4.0, the main building fragments were integrated quickly
   into nanotubes, and hence avoided further hydrolysis. Self-assembly of
   protease-induced alpha-lactalbumin nanotubes can thus be extended over a
   broad range of pH values. These findings might be useful for future
   applications in both food and pharmaceutical industries. (C) 2015

   to determine both the shape and localization of the membrane protein
   cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) while it is embedded in the phospholipid
   bilayer of a nanodisc. In order to accomplish this, a hybrid approach to

	Abstract = {{De novo design and chemical synthesis of proteins and of other
   artificial structures that mimic them is a central strategy for
   understanding protein folding and for accessing proteins with new
   functions. We have previously described carbohydrates that act as
   templates for the assembly of artificial proteins, so-called
   carboproteins. The hypothesis is that the template preorganizes the
   secondary structure elements and directs the formation of a tertiary
   structure, thus achieving structural economy in the combination of
   peptide, linker, and template. We speculate that the structural
   information from the template could facilitate protein folding. Here we
   report the design and synthesis of three-helix-bundle carboproteins on
   deoxyhexopyranosides. The carboproteins were analyzed by CD, analytical
   ultracentrifugation (AUC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and NMR
   spectroscopy, and this revealed the formation of the first compact and

	Abstract = {{Structural and functional aspects of high-density lipoproteins have been
   studied for over half a century. Due to the plasticity of this highly
   complex system, new aspects continue to be discovered. Here, we present
   a structural study of the human Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) and
   investigate the role of its N-terminal domain, the so-called globular
   domain of ApoA1, in discoidal complexes with phospholipids and
   increasing amounts of cholesterol. Using a combination of solution-based
   small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and molecular constrained data
   modeling, we show that the
   ApoA1-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)-based
   particles are disk shaped with an elliptical cross section and composed
   by a central lipid bilayer surrounded by two stabilizing ApoA1 proteins.
   This structure is very similar to the particles formed in the so-called
   nanodisc system, which is based on N-terminal truncated ApoA1 protein.
   Although it is commonly agreed that the nanodisc is plain disk shaped,
   several more advanced structures have been proposed for the full-length
   ApoA1 in combination with POPC and cholesterol. This prompted us to make
   a detailed comparative study of the ApoA1 and nanodisc systems upon
   cholesterol uptake. Based on the presented SAXS analysis it is found
   that the N-terminal domains of ApoA1-POPC-cholesterol particles are not
   globular but instead an integrated part of the protein belt stabilizing
   the particles. Upon incorporation of increasing amounts of cholesterol,
   the presence of the N-terminal domain allows the bilayer thickness to
   increase while maintaining an overall flat bilayer structure. This is
   contrasted by the energetically more strained and less favorable lens
   shape required to fit the SAXS data from the N-terminal truncated
   nanodisc system upon cholesterol incorporation. This suggests that the
   N-terminal domain of ApoA1 actively participates in the stabilization of
   the ApoA1-POPC-cholesterol discoidal particle and allows for a more
   optimal lipid packing upon cholesterol uptake.}},

	Abstract = {{PICK1 is a neuronal scaffolding protein containing a PDZ domain and an
   auto-inhibited BAR domain. BAR domains are membrane-sculpting protein
   modules generating membrane curvature and promoting membrane fission.
   Previous data suggest that BAR domains are organized in lattice-like
   arrangements when stabilizing membranes but little is known about
   structural organization of BAR domains in solution. Through a
   small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, we determine the structure
   of dimeric and tetrameric complexes of PICK1 in solution. SAXS and
   biochemical data reveal a strong propensity of PICK1 to form
   higher-order structures, and SAXS analysis suggests an offset, parallel
   mode of BAR-BAR oligomerization. Furthermore, unlike accessory domains
   in other BAR domain proteins, the positioning of the PDZ domains is
   flexible, enabling PICK1 to perform long-range, dynamic scaffolding of
   membrane-associated proteins. Together with functional data, these
   structural findings are compatible with a model in which oligomerization
   governs auto-inhibition of BAR domain function.}},

   When wet processed and dried into films, the nanoparticles lose their
   spherical shape and become flattened into oblate shapes with a large

	Abstract = {{The high flux at European Spallation Source (ESS) will allow for
   performing experiments with relatively small beam-sizes while
   maintaining a high intensity of the incoming beam. The pulsed nature of
   the source makes the facility optimal for time-of-flight small-angle
   neutron scattering (ToF-SANS). We find that a relatively compact SANS
   instrument becomes the optimal choice in order to obtain the widest
   possible q-range in a single setting and the best possible exploitation
   of the neutrons in each pulse and hence obtaining the highest possible
   flux at the sample position. The instrument proposed in the present
   article is optimised for performing fast measurements of small
   scattering volumes, typically down to 2 x 2 x 2 mm(3), while covering a
   broad q-range from about 0.005 1/angstrom to 0.5 1/angstrom in a single
   instrument setting. This q-range corresponds to that available at a
   typical good BioSAXS instrument and is relevant for a wide set of
   biomacromolecular samples. A central advantage of covering the whole
   q-range in a single setting is that each sample has to be loaded only
   once. This makes it convenient to use the fully automated
   high-throughput flow-through sample changers commonly applied at modern
   synchrotron BioSAXS-facilities. The central drawback of choosing a very
   compact instrument is that the resolution in terms of (delta
   lambda/lambda. obtained with the short wavelength neutrons becomes worse
   than what is usually the standard at state-of-the-art SANS instruments.
   Our McStas based simulations of the instrument performance for a set of
   characteristic biomacromolecular samples show that the resulting
   smearing effects still have relatively minor effects on the obtained
   data and can be compensated for in the data analysis. However, in cases
   where a better resolution is required in combination with the large
   simultaneous q-range characteristic of the instrument, we show that this
   can be obtained by inserting a set of choppers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {{Structural studies of membrane proteins remain a great experimental
   challenge. Functional reconstitution into artificial nanoscale bilayer
   disc carriers that mimic the native bilayer environment allows the
   handling of membrane proteins in solution. This enables the use of
   small-angle scattering techniques for fast and reliable structural
   analysis. The difficulty with this approach is that the carrier discs
   contribute to the measured scattering intensity in a highly nontrivial
   fashion, making subsequent data analysis challenging. Here, an elegant
   solution to circumvent the intrinsic complexity brought about by the
   presence of the carrier disc is presented. In combination with
   small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and the D,D2O/H2O-based solvent
   contrast-variation method, it is demonstrated that it is possible to
   prepare specifically deuterated carriers that become invisible to

	Abstract = {{In most temperate bacteriophages, regulation of the choice of lysogenic
   or lytic life cycle is controlled by a CI repressor protein. Inhibition
   of transcription is dependent on a helix-turn-helix motif, often located
   in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which binds to specific DNA sequences
   (operator sites). Here the crystal structure of the NTD of the CI
   repressor from phage TP901-1 has been determined at 1.6 angstrom
   resolution, and at 2.6 angstrom resolution in complex with a 9 bp
   double-stranded DNA fragment that constitutes a half-site of the O-L
   operator. This N-terminal construct, comprising residues 2-74 of the CI
   repressor, is monomeric in solution as shown by nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR), small angle X-ray scattering, and gel filtration and is
   monomeric in the crystal structures. The binding interface between the
   NTD and the half-site in the crystal is very similar to the interface
   that can be mapped by NMR in solution with a full palindromic site. The
   interactions seen in the complexes (in the crystal and in solution)
   explain the observed affinity for the O-R site that is lower than that
   for the O-L site and the specificity for the recognized DNA sequence in
   comparison to that for other repressors. Compared with many well-studied
   phage repressor systems, the NTD from TP901-1 CI has a longer extended
   scaffolding helix that, interestingly, is strongly conserved in putative
   repressors of Gram-positive pathogens. On the basis of sequence
   comparisons, we suggest that these bacteria also possess
   repressor/antirepressor systems similar to that found in phage TP901-1.}},

	Abstract = {{The swelling behaviour of water-oil microemulsions - considering a
   surfactant layer between oil and water - has been studied using a two
   level-cuts Gaussian random field approach based on the Helfrich
   formalism. Microstructures and scattering properties of microemulsions
   have been calculated for different amounts of oil (and water) for
   flexible and rigid microemulsions. When the stiffness, the spontaneous
   curvature of the interfacial film, and the surface to volume ratio of
   the immiscible fluids are varied, the microemulsion topology and
   morphology change in order to minimize the microemulsion free energy.
   Our simulations point out a change in the microemulsion morphology as a
   function of the surfactant film rigidity and the composition of oil,
   water and the surfactant. Locally lamellar structures are found for
   rigid microemulsions, whereas for more flexible ones, the
   connected-droplet and/or bicontinuous structures are preferred.
   Furthermore, we show that the microemulsion swelling versus the volume
   fraction gives a specific signature of the microemulsion microstructure.
   This allows for discriminating between different types of
   microemulsions: flexible, frustrated and unfrustrated (close to
   bi-liquid foams), and connected structures as molten hexagonal and cubic
   phases. The universal swelling behaviour is compared to different
   analytic expressions of Disordered Open Connected (DOC) models for the
   microemulsion swelling versus the volume fraction.}},

	Abstract = {{Precise control of the oligomeric state of proteins is of central
   importance for biological function and for the properties of
   biopharmaceutical drugs. Here, the self-assembly of 2,2'-bipyridine
   conjugated monomeric insulin analogues, induced through coordination to
   divalent metal ions, was studied. This protein drug system was designed
   to form non-native homo-oligomers through selective coordination of two
   divalent metal ions, Fe(II) and Zn(II), respectively. The insulin type
   chosen for this study is a variant designed for a reduced tendency
   toward native dimer formation at physiological concentrations. A
   small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of the bipyridine-modified insulin
   system confirmed an organization into a novel well-ordered structure
   based on insulin trimers, as induced by the addition of Fe(II). In
   contrast, unmodified monomeric insulin formed larger and more randomly
   structured assemblies upon addition of Fe(II). The addition of Zn(II),
   on the other hand, led to the formation of small quantities of insulin
   hexamers for both the bipyridine-modified and the unmodified monomeric
   insulin. Interestingly, the location of the bipyridine-modification
   significantly affects the tendency to hexamer formation as compared to
   the unmodified insulin. Our study shows how combining a structural study
   and chemical design can be used to obtain molecular understanding and
   control of the self-assembly of a protein drug. This knowledge may
   eventually be employed to develop an optimized in vivo drug release
   profile.}},

   using a non-native recognition principle, for control of protein
   self-assembly based on intermolecular fluorous interactions and
   demonstrate it for the small protein insulin. Perfluorinated alkyl
   chains of varying length were attached to desB30 human insulin by
   acylation of the E-amine of the side-chain of LysB29. The insulin
   analogues were formulated with Zn(II) and phenol to form hexamers. The
   self-segregation of fluorous groups directed the insulin hexamers to
   self-assemble. The structures of the systems were investigated by
   circular dichroism I (CD) spectroscopy and synchrotron small-angle X-ray
   scattering. Also, the binding affinity to the 4 insulin receptor was
   measured. Interestingly, varying the length of the perfluoroalkyl chain
   provided three different scenarios for self-assembly; the short chains
   hardly affected the native hexameric structure, the medium-length chains
   induced fractal-like structures with the insulin hexamer as the
   fundamental building block, while the longest chains lead to the
   formation of structures with local cylindrical geometry. This
   hierarchical self-assembly system, which combines Zn(II) mediated
   hexamer formation with fluorous interactions, is a promising tool to
   control the formation of high molecular weight complexes of insulin and

	Abstract = {{Nanodiscs are self-assembled nanostructures composed of a belt protein
   and a small patch of lipid bilayer, which can solubilize membrane
   proteins in a lipid bilayer environment. We present a method for the
   alignment of a well-defined two-dimensional layer of nanodiscs at the
   air-water interface by careful design of an insoluble surfactant
   monolayer at the surface. We used neutron reflectivity to demonstrate
   the feasibility of this approach and to elucidate the structure of the
   nanodisc layer. The proof of concept is hereby presented with the use of
   nanodiscs composed of a mixture of two different lipid (DMPC and DMPG)
   types to obtain a net overall negative charge of the nanodiscs. We find
   that the nanodisc layer has a thickness or 40.9 +/- 2.6 angstrom with a
   surface coverage of 66 +/- 4\%. This layer is located about 15 angstrom
   below a cationic surfactant layer at the air water interface. The high
   level of organization within the nanodiscs layer is reflected by a low
   interfacial roughness (similar to 4.5 angstrom) found. The use of the
   nanodisc as a biomimetic model of the cell membrane allows for studies
   of single membrane proteins isolated in a confined lipid environment.
   The 2D alignment of nanodiscs could therefore enable studies of
   high-density layers containing membrane proteins that, in contrast to
   membrane proteins reconstituted in a continuous lipid bilayer, remain

   perform a complete analysis cycle, including sample mixing, SAXS
   measurement, continuous UV absorbance measurements, and cleaning of the

	Abstract = {{It is well established that small sugars exert different types of
   stabilization of biomembranes both in vivo and in vitro. However, the
   essential question of whether sugars are bound to or expelled from
   membrane surfaces, i.e., the sign and size of the free energy of the
   interaction, remains unresolved, and this prevents a molecular
   understanding of the stabilizing mechanism. We have used small-angle
   neutron scattering and thermodynamic measurements to show that sugars
   may be either bound or expelled depending on the concentration of sugar.
   At low concentration, small sugars bind quite strongly to a lipid
   bilayer, and the accumulation of sugar at the interface makes the
   membrane thinner and laterally expanded. Above similar to 0.2 M the
   sugars gradually become expelled from the membrane surface, and this
   repulsive mode of interaction counteracts membrane thinning. The dual
   nature of sugar-membrane interactions offers a reconciliation of
   conflicting views in earlier reports on sugar-induced modulations of
   membrane properties.}},

	Abstract = {{Nanodiscs (TM) consist of small phospholipid bilayer discs surrounded
   and stabilized by amphiphilic protein belts. Nanodiscs and their
   confinement and stabilization of nanometer sized pieces of phospholipid
   bilayer are highly interesting from a membrane physics point of view. We
   demonstrate how the detailed structure of Di-Lauroyl-Phosphatidyl
   Choline (DLPC) nanodiscs may be determined by simultaneous fitting of a
   structural model to small-angle scattering data from the nanodiscs as
   investigated in three different contrast situations, respectively two
   SANS contrasts and one SAXS contrast. The article gives a detailed
   account of the underlying structural model for the nanodiscs and
   describe how additional chemical and biophysical information can be
   incorporated in the model in terms of molecular constraints. We discuss
   and quantify the contribution from the different elements of the
   structural model and provide very strong experimental support for the
   nanodiscs as having an elliptical cross-section and with poly-histidine
   tags protruding out from the rim of the protein belt. The analysis also
   provides unprecedented information about the structural conformation of
   the phospholipids when these are localized in the nanodiscs. The model
   paves the first part of the way in order to reach our long term goal of
   using the nanodiscs as a platform for small-angle scattering based
   structural investigations of membrane proteins in solution.}},

	Abstract = {{Phospholipid bilayers host and support the function of membrane proteins
   and may be stabilized in disc-like nanostructures, allowing for
   unprecedented solution studies of the assembly, structure, and function
   of membrane proteins (Bayburt et al Nano Lett. 2002, 2, 853-856) Based
   on small-angle neutron scattering in combination with
   variable-temperature studies of synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering
   on nanodiscs in solution, we show that the fundamental nanodisc unit,
   consisting of a lipid bilayer surrounded by amphiphilic scaffold
   proteins, possesses intrinsically an elliptical shape. The temperature
   dependence of the curvature of the nanodiscs prepared with two different
   phospholipid types (DLPC and POPC) shows that it is the scaffold protein
   that determines the overall elliptical shape and that the nanodiscs
   become more circular with increasing temperature. Our data also show
   that the hydrophobic bilayer thickness is, to a large extent, dictated
   by the scaffolding protein and adjusted to minimize the hydrophobic
   mismatch between protein and phospholipid Our conclusions result from a
   new comprehensive and molecular-based model of the nanodisc structure
   and the use of this to analyze the experimental scattering profile from
   nanodiscs The model paves the way for future detailed structural studies

   commonly applied ways of increasing both in vitro and in vivo stability

   liposomes because the PEG corona renders the liposomes invisible to the
   macrophages in the bloodstream. The first detailed small-angle neutron

   analytical model for the PEG-modified liposomes is derived, where the
   liposomes are described as a water core surrounded by a bilayer lipid
   film with grafted polymer chains in a Gaussian random coil conformation
   attached to the inside and the outside lipid leaflets. There is an
   excellent agreement between the obtained experimental data and the
   proposed structural model of the liposomes. These results are the most

	Abstract = {{Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are small, membrane-bound organelles that are
   found in the synaptic terminal of neurons, and which are crucial in
   neurotransmission. After a rise in internal {[}Ca2+] during neuronal
   stimulation, SVs fuse with the plasma membrane releasing their
   neurotransmitter content, which then signals neighboring neurons. SVs
   are subsequently recycled and refilled with neurotransmitter for further
   rounds of release. Recently, tremendous progress has been made in
   elucidating the molecular composition of SVs, as well as putative
   protein-protein interactions. However, what is lacking is an empirical
   description of SV structure at the supramolecular level which is
   necessary to enable us to fully understand the processes of membrane
   fusion, retrieval, and recycling. Using small-angle x-ray scattering, we
   have directly investigated the size and structure of purified SVs. From
   this information, we deduced detailed size and density parameters for
   the protein layers responsible for SV function, as well as information
   about the lipid bilayer. To achieve a convincing model fit, a laterally
   anisotropic structure for the protein shell is needed, as a rotationally
   symmetric density profile does not explain the data. Not only does our
   model confirm many of the preexisting ideas concerning SV structure, but
   also for the first time, to our knowledge, it indicates structural
   refinements, such as the presence of protein microdomains.}},

	Abstract = {Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering have become increasingly popular owing to improvements in instrumentation and developments in data analysis, sample handling and sample preparation. For some time, it has been suggested that a more systematic approach to the quantification of the information content in small-angle scattering data would allow for a more optimal experiment planning and a more reliable data analysis. In the present article, it is shown how ray-tracing techniques in combination with a statistically rigorous data analysis provide an appropriate platform for such a systematic quantification of the information content in scattering data. As examples of applications, it is shown how the exposure time at different instrumental settings or contrast situations can be optimally prioritized in an experiment. Also, the gain in information by combining small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering is assessed. While solution small-angle scattering data of proteins and protein--lipid complexes are used as examples in the present case study, the approach is generalizable to a wide range of other samples and experimental techniques. The source code for the algorithms and ray-tracing components developed for this study has been made available on-line.},

@article{Pedersen2015,
	Abstract = {This journal is {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015. Water based inks would be a strong advantage for large scale production of organic photovoltaic devices. Formation of water dispersible nanoparticles produced by the Landfester method is a promising route to achieve such inks. We provide new insights into the key ink properties of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) nanoparticles such as the internal structure and crystallinity of the dispersed nanoparticles and the previously unreported drastic changes that occur when the inks are cast into a film. We observe through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) that the nanoparticles in dispersion are spherical with the nanodomains of P3HT being partly crystalline. When wet processed and dried into films, the nanoparticles lose their spherical shape and become flattened into oblate shapes with a large aspect ratio. Most particles are observed to have a diameter 13 times of the particle height. After casting into a film, the crystal domains adopt a preferred orientation with the majority of the nanocrystals (68{\%}) with face-on orientation to the substrate. We propose that low substrate surface energy is responsible for particle deformation and texturing.},

@article{Morup2012,
	Abstract = {We have investigated the evolution of crystal structure, cation disorder and magnetic properties of ilmenite (FeTiO3) after increasing time of high-energy ball-milling in an inert atmosphere. Refinement of X-ray diffraction data show that the hexagonal crystal structure of ilmenite is maintained after high- energy ball-milling of up to 128 h, but neutron diffraction studies reveal significant cation redistribu- tion of Fe2þ and Ti4þ ions in the ball-milled samples. M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy studies show that the magnetic hyperfine field of Fe2þ, which is around 5 T before ball-milling, increases, and after milling times longer than 4 h a broad distribution of hyperfine fields with values up to around 40 T for Fe2þ is seen. This can be explained by the cphation disorder induced by the ball-milling which affects the orbital contribution to the magnetic hyperfine field. In contrast to some ball-milled spinel ferrites, the N{\'{e}}el temperature of ilmenite is not significantly affected by the cation disorder.},
