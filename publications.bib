	Abstract = {A software framework for analysis of small-angle scattering data is presented. On the basis of molecular constraints and prior knowledge of the chemical composition of the sample, the software is capable of simultaneously fitting small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data to analytical or semi-analytical models of biomacromolecules. The software features various fitting routines along with the possibility of incorporating instrumental resolution effects on the fit. Finally, trust region estimation, based on the profile likelihood strategy, is implemented. The algorithms and models are written in C, whereas the user interface is written in Python. Parallelization is implemented using the OpenMP extensions to C. The source code is available for free upon request or {\{}$\backslash$it via{\}} the associated code repository. The software runs on Linux, Windows and OSX and is available as an open-source initiative published under the General Publishing License.},

	Abstract = {Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering have become increasingly popular owing to improvements in instrumentation and developments in data analysis, sample handling and sample preparation. For some time, it has been suggested that a more systematic approach to the quantification of the information content in small-angle scattering data would allow for a more optimal experiment planning and a more reliable data analysis. In the present article, it is shown how ray-tracing techniques in combination with a statistically rigorous data analysis provide an appropriate platform for such a systematic quantification of the information content in scattering data. As examples of applications, it is shown how the exposure time at different instrumental settings or contrast situations can be optimally prioritized in an experiment. Also, the gain in information by combining small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering is assessed. While solution small-angle scattering data of proteins and protein--lipid complexes are used as examples in the present case study, the approach is generalizable to a wide range of other samples and experimental techniques. The source code for the algorithms and ray-tracing components developed for this study has been made available on-line.},

	Abstract = {This journal is {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015. Water based inks would be a strong advantage for large scale production of organic photovoltaic devices. Formation of water dispersible nanoparticles produced by the Landfester method is a promising route to achieve such inks. We provide new insights into the key ink properties of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) nanoparticles such as the internal structure and crystallinity of the dispersed nanoparticles and the previously unreported drastic changes that occur when the inks are cast into a film. We observe through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) that the nanoparticles in dispersion are spherical with the nanodomains of P3HT being partly crystalline. When wet processed and dried into films, the nanoparticles lose their spherical shape and become flattened into oblate shapes with a large aspect ratio. Most particles are observed to have a diameter 13 times of the particle height. After casting into a film, the crystal domains adopt a preferred orientation with the majority of the nanocrystals (68{\%}) with face-on orientation to the substrate. We propose that low substrate surface energy is responsible for particle deformation and texturing.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the evolution of crystal structure, cation disorder and magnetic properties of ilmenite (FeTiO3) after increasing time of high-energy ball-milling in an inert atmosphere. Refinement of X-ray diffraction data show that the hexagonal crystal structure of ilmenite is maintained after high- energy ball-milling of up to 128 h, but neutron diffraction studies reveal significant cation redistribu- tion of Fe2þ and Ti4þ ions in the ball-milled samples. M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy studies show that the magnetic hyperfine field of Fe2þ, which is around 5 T before ball-milling, increases, and after milling times longer than 4 h a broad distribution of hyperfine fields with values up to around 40 T for Fe2þ is seen. This can be explained by the cphation disorder induced by the ball-milling which affects the orbital contribution to the magnetic hyperfine field. In contrast to some ball-milled spinel ferrites, the N{\'{e}}el temperature of ilmenite is not significantly affected by the cation disorder.},
